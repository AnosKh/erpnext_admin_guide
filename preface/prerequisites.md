## 1.3 Prerequisites

To be proficient in the tasks that this book describes, the reader needs to have a good understanding of the following:

* Linux server administration (any distribution is fine)
    * Installation, patching, users, hardening for hosting externally, etc.
    * Getting around the operating system, running shell commands, editing files, etc.<br /><br />
* MySQL (or MariaDB) administration
    * The frappe `bench` utility does most of the work for the administrator, but having a good understanding of backups, restore, `innodb` file handling and other concepts is very important. The whole system lives in the database! This is the database that runs your business, so keep it managed.
    * If you plan to do any report writing, having a good understand of `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE` and other clauses for running queries is going to be handy.<br /><br />
* `nginx` administration
    * This book gives some aid and recipes for tasks, but understanding the underlying architecture of the web server will come in handy.<br /><br />
