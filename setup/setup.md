# 4.0 Setup

## 4.1 The Setup Wizard

The Setup Wizard handles all of the initial setup steps on a brand new install. Once [installation](../i-u-b/install "Install ERPNext") has been completed and confirmed, open a browser window to the network name you gave the installation. Logon with user `Administrator` and the password you gave `install.py` at installation. If you don't recall the password, it was saved for you.

    sudo cat /home/erpnext/passwords.txt

The `admin_password` is what you are looking for.

The current users manual does a good job explaining the Setup Wizard. The Setup Wizard will walk you through a collection of questions to do a base setup of your company. See [4.2 Domains](domains "ERPNext Domains") for more information on the impact of selecting a domain for your organization. 

<https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/setup-wizard>

When the Setup Wizard as completed, you will be redirected to the ERPNext Desk (Desktop) as the user that you created during the wizard. You will then be prompted to answer another set of questions to complete the initial setup of your environment.<br /><br />
