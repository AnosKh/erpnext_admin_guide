## 2.2 Getting Help

There are a number of places to get help with your ERPNext installation. 

* The first and obvious place to get help is the discuss forum at [https://discuss.erpnext.com/](https://discuss.erpnext.com/ "Discuss ERPNext"). Sign up and join the conversation!<br /><br />
* ERPNext is based on the Frappe Framework. There is a separate discuss forum at [https://discuss.frappe.io/](https://discuss.frappe.io/ "Discuss Frappe Framework")<br /><br />
* There is an open gitter chat group that you can sign into at [https://gitter.im/frappe/erpnext](https://gitter.im/frappe/erpnext "Gitter.im Channel for ERPNext")<br /><br />
* There is the ERPNext GitHub repository at [https://github.com/frappe/erpnext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext "ERPNext GitHub Repo"). This is where a person would enter in new issues and check out new releases. See [3.3 Upgrading](../i-u-b/upgrade "Upgrading ERPNext").<br /><br />
* As any good system, there is a user manual at [https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/ "ERPNext User Manual"). If you have not read it from front to back, you should. The English language version is the most complete.<br /><br />
* There are a number of helpful videos that the ERPNext team has created at [https://erpnext.org/docs/user/videos/learn/](https://erpnext.org/docs/user/videos/learn/ "ERPNext Video Tutorials").<br /><br />
